# EDTaupeEye
Elite Dangerous Tool (using Tobii Eye trackers to play with Elite  Dangerous) From **Galactic 911**

**Project in progress** [123-------]

## **Abstract**   

- **EDTaupeEye** is an interface that allows you to use the **[Tobii Eye Trackers](https://gaming.tobii.com/product/eye-tracker-5)** to play **[Elite Dangerous](https://www.elitedangerous.com)**. 
The overlay splits the screen into multiple areas that can be activated individually using gazing 
and blinking to simulate a mouse click.

- **EdTaupeEye** reads the *Cutom.3.binds* file in order to know the keyboard shortcuts. He can add his 
own shortcuts to access all the functions available in Elite Dangerous. The tool keeps a history 
of changes it has made to the file.

- **EdTaupeEye** also scans the *Status.json* file to contextually adapt the functions that can be displayed.
